# Contributing

Instructions for contributing to [plaid-go][1]. A go client library for the [Plaid API][2]. This library is fully generated from the [Plaid OpenAPI spec](3).

## Running Tests

1. To build the docker image for the client tests, run `docker build -t plaid-go .`.
2. Go to the [Plaid Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/) and copy and paste your `client_id` and sandbox `secret` into the following command.
3. Run `docker run --rm -e CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID -e SECRET=$SECRET plaid-go`.

If you wish to run a single test, do something like this:

```
CLIENT_ID="" SECRET="" go test -v ./... -run TESTNAME
```
