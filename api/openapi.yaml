        The `/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification numbers (such as routing numbers, for US accounts) associated with an Item's checking and savings accounts, along with high-level account data and balances when available.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `auth` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

  /transactions/get:
    post:
      description: |-
        The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products#investments) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

  /transactions/refresh:
    post:
      description: |-
        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#deleted-transactions-detected) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get`.

        Returns a JSON response containing details on all financial institutions currently supported by Plaid. Because Plaid supports thousands of institutions, results are paginated.

        If there is no overlap between an institution’s enabled products and a client’s enabled products, then the institution will be filtered out from the response. As a result, the number of institutions returned may not match the count specified in the call.

        This data changes frequently. If you store it locally on your system, be sure to update it regularly.

        The `/item/remove`  endpoint allows you to remove an Item. Once removed, the `access_token`  associated with the Item is no longer valid and cannot be used to access any data that was associated with the Item.

        Note that in the Development environment, issuing an `/item/remove`  request will not decrement your live credential count. To increase your credential account in Development, contact Support.

        Also note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.

        The `/accounts/get`  endpoint can be used to retrieve information for any linked Item. Note that some information is nullable. Plaid will only return active bank accounts, i.e. accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.

        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead.

        for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance
        object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance

        Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can
        be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance`
        itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link.

        The `/identity/get` endpoint allows you to retrieve various account holder information on file with the financial institution, including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Only name data is guaranteed to be returned; other fields will be empty arrays if not provided by the institution.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

          The `/processor/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for the account associated with a given `processor_token`.

          The current balance is the total amount of funds in the account. The available balance is the current balance less any outstanding holds or debits that have not yet posted to the account.

          Note that not all institutions calculate the available balance. In the event that available balance is unavailable from the institution, Plaid will return an available balance value of `null`.

  /item/access_token/invalidate:
    post:
      description: |
        By default, the `access_token` associated with an Item does not expire and should be stored in a persistent, secure manner.

        You can use the `/item/access_token/invalidate` endpoint to rotate the `access_token` associated with an Item. The endpoint returns a new `access_token` and immediately invalidates the previous `access_token`.

  /liabilities/get:
    post:
      description: |-
        The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).

        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

        Create a payment recipient for payment initiation.  The recipient must be in Europe, within a country that is a member of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA).  For a standing order (recurring) payment, the recipient must be in the UK.

        The endpoint is idempotent: if a developer has already made a request with the same payment details, Plaid will return the same `recipient_id`.

    post:
      description: |-
        After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.

        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR. For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

      description: |-
        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer, `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used to initialize Link.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires, you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment token does not require end user input.

        `/sandbox/item/reset_login/` forces an Item into an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow in the Sandbox environment.  After calling `/sandbox/item/reset_login`, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore the Item to a good state. An `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.


        In the Sandbox, Items will transition to an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error state automatically after 30 days, even if this endpoint is not called.

      description: |-
        Note: As of July 2020, the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is deprecated. Instead, use `/link/token/create` with an `access_token` to create a Link token for use with [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).

        If you need your user to take action to restore or resolve an error associated with an Item, generate a public token with the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint and then initialize Link with that `public_token`.

        A `public_token` is one-time use and expires after 30 minutes. You use a `public_token` to initialize Link in [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) for a particular Item. You can generate a `public_token` for an Item even if you did not use Link to create the Item originally.

        The `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is **not** used to create your initial `public_token`. If you have not already received an `access_token` for a specific Item, use Link to obtain your `public_token` instead. See the [Quickstart](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart) for more information.

  /asset_report/create:

      description: |-
        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.

        The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/#Assets-webhooks).

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.

      description: |-
        An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

        The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to `/asset_report/filter`. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original `/asset_report/create` request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to `/asset_report/refresh`. Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

  /asset_report/remove:
    post:
      description: |-
        The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to invalidate an `access_token`, meaning you will not be able to create new Asset Reports with it. Removing an Item does not affect any Asset Reports or Audit Copies you have already created, which will remain accessible until you remove them specifically.

        The `/asset_report/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Asset Report. Removing an Asset Report invalidates its `asset_report_token`, meaning you will no longer be able to use it to access Report data or create new Audit Copies. Removing an Asset Report does not affect the underlying Items, but does invalidate any `audit_copy_tokens` associated with the Asset Report.

  /asset_report/filter:
    post:
      description: |-
        By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Select Account view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

        To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

        Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

        Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

  /asset_report/get:

      description: |-
        The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling `/asset_report/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.

        To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

        The `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/asset_report/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        The response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id`  is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

  /asset_report/audit_copy/create:
    post:
      description: |-
        Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

        To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

  /asset_report/audit_copy/remove:
    post:
      description: The `/asset_report/audit_copy/remove` endpoint allows you to remove
        an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated
        with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no
        longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the
        Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not
        affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.

        The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to retrieve user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

        Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

  /item/import:
    post:
      description: |-
        `/item/import` creates an Item via your Plaid Exchange Integration and returns an `access_token`. As part of an `/item/import` request, you will include a User ID (`user_auth.user_id`) and Authentication Token (`user_auth.auth_token`) that enable data aggregation through your Plaid Exchange API endpoints. These authentication principals are to be chosen by you.

        Upon creating an Item via `/item/import`, Plaid will automatically begin an extraction of that Item through the Plaid Exchange infrastructure you have already integrated. This will automatically generate the Plaid native account ID for the account the user will switch their direct deposit to (`target_account_id`).

  /link/token/create:

      description: |-
        The `/link/token/create` endpoint creates a `link_token`, which is required as a parameter when initializing Link. Once Link has been initialized, it returns a `public_token`, which can then be exchanged for an `access_token` via `/item/public_token/exchange` as part of the main Link flow.

        A `link_token` generated by `/link/token/create` is also used to initialize other Link flows, such as the update mode flow for tokens with expired credentials, or the Payment Initiation (Europe) flow.

  /bank_transfer/balance/get:
    post:
      description: |-
        Use the `/bank_transfer/balance/get` endpoint to see the available balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.

        The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.

        Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform configuration.

  /employers/search:
    post:
      description: |-
        `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaid’s database of known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.

        The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.

            If the balance that is pulled for `ins_128026` (Capital One) is older than the given timestamp, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.

            This field is only used when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One), in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, this field is ignored.

            If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. To gain access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.

            If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in `country_codes`. If both `country_codes` and a Link customization are used, the value in `country_codes` may override the value in the customization.

            If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or Automated Micro-deposits, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.

            Example: `['auth', 'transactions']`

            `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initalization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.

            Only institutions that support *all* requested products will be shown in Link; to maximize the number of institutions listed, it is recommended to initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/best-practices/#choosing-when-to-initialize-products).

            Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.

            In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`.

      additionalProperties: true
      description: |
        By default, Link will provide limited account filtering: it will only display Institutions that are compatible with all products supplied in the `products` parameter of `/link/token/create`, and, if `auth` is specified in the `products` array, will also filter out accounts other than `checking` and `savings` accounts on the Select Account pane. You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#accounts-schema).

        For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts, the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update.

      description: |
        The status of an institution is determined by the health of its Item logins, Transactions updates, Investments updates, Auth requests, Balance requests, and Identity requests. A login attempt is conducted during the initial Item add in Link. If there is not enough traffic to accurately calculate an institution's status, Plaid will return null rather than potentially inaccurate data.

        Institution status is accessible in the Dashboard and via the API using the `/institutions/get_by_id` endpoint with the `include_status` option set to true. Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.

The number of days between each transaction and the Item creation will remain constant. For example, an Item created on December 15 might show a transaction on December 14. An Item created on December 20, using the same seed, would show that same transaction occurring on December 19.
