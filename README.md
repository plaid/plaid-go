## Documentation

The module supports all Plaid API endpoints.

GoDoc: [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/plaid/plaid-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid)

## Getting Started

### Calling Endpoints

To call an endpoint you must create a `Client` object.

```go
import (
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid"
)

clientOptions := plaid.ClientOptions{
    os.Getenv("PLAID_CLIENT_ID"),
    os.Getenv("PLAID_SECRET"),
    plaid.Sandbox, // Available environments are Sandbox, Development, and Production
    &http.Client{}, // This parameter is optional
}
client, err := plaid.NewClient(clientOptions)
```

Each endpoint returns an object which contains the parsed JSON from the HTTP response.

### Errors

All non-200 responses will return a plaid.Error instance.

For more information on Plaid response codes, head to the [docs](https://plaid.com/docs/api#errors).

## Developing

1. Download this repo into your Go source directory
2. Run `make setup` pull down all dependencies etc

### Tests

To run the tests you'll need to sign up for a Sandbox account on https://plaid.com as they perform real API requests.

Once you have these you can run `make test`, passing your Sandbox credentials as environment variables:

```shell
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=aabbcc PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY=ddeeff PLAID_SECRET=ffeedd make test
```
