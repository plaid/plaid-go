# Publish guide

`github.plaid.com/plaid/plaid-go` uses semantic versioning with git tags to
track releases.

1. Ensure that you have cloned this repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/plaid/plaid-go`

2. Checkout the `master` branch and pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git fetch --tags
```

3. Create and merge a PR to update `CHANGELOG.md`

4. Creating a new release is simple and bundled into a single make command. Use
semantic versioning to determine whether a release should be one of the follow
version bumps:
- `patch`
- `minor`
- `major`

```bash
GO111MODULE=off make release-(patch|minor|major)
```

The `make release-%` command will do the following executions automatically:
- Bump the `internal/version_autogenerated.go` version
- Commit and tag the new version
- Push the commit to `plaid-go` GitHub repository

4. Push the newly created `tag` to GitHub:

```
git push --follow-tags
```
