This library is generated from an OpenAPI schema (OAS). See full changelog [here](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-openapi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for schema changes.

# 2.0.1
- Updating to OAS 2020-09-14_1.64.14
- Fix issue with nullable strings incorrectly reporting if they are set.

## OpenAPI Schema Changes
### 2020-09-14_1.64.14
- Made `last_payment_amount` and `last_statement_issue_date` `nullable` for credit card liabilities schema to reflect existing API behavior.
- Fix transfers examples to reflect more consistent usage of `region` field.

### 2020-09-14_1.64.13
- Deprecate `idempotency_key` parameter in transfer/create

### 2020-09-14_1.64.12

### 2020-09-14_1.64.11

### 2020-09-14_1.64.10
- Updated the external docs URL for Bank Transfers sandbox endpoints

# 2.0.0
- Updating to OAS 2020-09-14_1.64.9

## Breaking changes
- `InstitutionsGetRequestOptions.Oauth` went from a `PtrBool` -> `NullableBool` as it's now nullable.
- `InstitutionsSearchRequestOptions` fields changed to nullable (so `NullableBool`):
   - `.Oauth`
   - `.IncludeAuthMetadata`
   - `.IncludePaymentInitiationMetadata`
- To migrate from `PtrBool` -> `NullableBool`, set the value to a `*plaid.NewNullableBool(plaid.PtrBool(bool))`. For an example, check out how `Oauth` is set in `/tests/institutions_test.go`.
- Split `AccountSubtype` enums and objects into per-endpoint ones to more accurately represent allowed values.
  - Fixed a bug with `LinkTokenCreateRequestAccountSubtypes` having unconditional maps as parameters instead of models
  - `DepositoryFilter`'s account subtypes uses `DepositoryAccountSubtypes`
  - `CreditFilter`'s account subtypes uses `CreditAccountSubtypes`
  - `LoanFilter`'s account subtypes uses `LoanAccountSubtypes`
  - `InvestmentFilter`'s account subtypes uses `InvestmentAccountSubtypes`

- Introduce the `ToPlaidError` helper function to convert generic errors to the plaid.Error struct

# 0.1.0-beta-1
We first are reversioning this package, as we are now using GOMODULES.

This version represents a transition in how we maintain our external client libraries. We are now using an [API spec](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-openapi) written in `OpenAPI 3.0.0` and running our definition file through [OpenAPITool's `go` generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

**Go Migration Guide:**

## Client initialization
From:
```go
import (
  "github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid"
)

client, err := plaid.NewClient(plaid.ClientOptions{
  os.Getenv("PLAID_CLIENT_ID"),
  os.Getenv("PLAID_SECRET"),
  plaid.Sandbox,
})

```

To:
```go
import (
  "github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid"
)

configuration := plaid.NewConfiguration()
configuration.AddDefaultHeader("PLAID-CLIENT-ID", os.Getenv("CLIENT_ID"))
configuration.AddDefaultHeader("PLAID-SECRET", os.Getenv("SECRET"))
configuration.UseEnvironment(plaid.Sandbox)

client := plaid.NewAPIClient(configuration)
```

## Endpoints
All endpoint rquests now take a request model and the functions have been renamed to move the
verb to the end (e.g. `GetBalances` is now `BalancesGet`). We now accept a `context` object in order to give the caller more control over the [http request](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.WithContext).

From:
```go
response, err := client.CreateSandboxPublicToken(SandboxInstitution, TestProducts)
```

To:
```go
response, httpResponse, err := client.PlaidApi.SandboxPublicTokenCreate(context.Background()).SandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
    *plaid.NewSandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
      SandboxInstitution,
      TestProducts,
    ),
   ).Execute()
```

## Errors
From:
```go
response, err := client.CreateSandboxPublicToken(SandboxInstitution, TestProducts)

plaidErr := err.(plaid.Error)
```

To:
```go
response, httpResponse, err := client.PlaidApi.SandboxPublicTokenCreate(context.Background()).SandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
    *plaid.NewSandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
      SandboxInstitution,
      TestProducts,
    ),
   ).Execute()

plaidErr, _ := plaid.ToPlaidError(err)
```
