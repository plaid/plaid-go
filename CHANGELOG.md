## 0.1.0-beta-1
We first are reversioning this package, as we are now using GOMODULES.

This version represents a transition in how we maintain our external client libraries. We are now using an [API spec](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-openapi) written in `OpenAPI 3.0.0` and running our definition file through [OpenAPITool's `go` generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

**Go Migration Guide:**

### Client initialization
From:
```go
import (
  "github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid"
)

client, err := plaid.NewClient(plaid.ClientOptions{
  os.Getenv("PLAID_CLIENT_ID"),
  os.Getenv("PLAID_SECRET"),
  plaid.Sandbox,
})

```

To:
```go
import (
  "github.com/plaid/plaid-go/plaid"
)

configuration := plaid.NewConfiguration()
configuration.AddDefaultHeader("PLAID-CLIENT-ID", os.Getenv("CLIENT_ID"))
configuration.AddDefaultHeader("PLAID-SECRET", os.Getenv("SECRET"))
configuration.UseEnvironment(plaid.Sandbox)

client := plaid.NewAPIClient(configuration)
```

### Endpoints
All endpoint rquests now take a request model and the functions have been renamed to move the
verb to the end (e.g. `GetBalances` is now `BalancesGet`). We now accept a `context` object in order to give the caller more control over the [http request](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.WithContext).

From:
```go
response, err := client.CreateSandboxPublicToken(SandboxInstitution, TestProducts)
```

To:
```go
response, httpResponse, err := client.PlaidApi.SandboxPublicTokenCreate(context.Background()).SandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
    *plaid.NewSandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
      SandboxInstitution,
      TestProducts,
    ),
   ).Execute()
```

### Errors
From:
```go
response, err := client.CreateSandboxPublicToken(SandboxInstitution, TestProducts)

plaidErr := err.(plaid.Error)
```

To:
```go
response, httpResponse, err := client.PlaidApi.SandboxPublicTokenCreate(context.Background()).SandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
    *plaid.NewSandboxPublicTokenCreateRequest(
      SandboxInstitution,
      TestProducts,
    ),
   ).Execute()

plaidErr, _ := plaid.ToPlaidError(err)
```
